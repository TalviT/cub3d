# TODO

## Mandatory:
* [x] 3D scene rendering using raycasting.
	* [x] Basic drawing utilities
	* [x] Raycasting algorithm (DDA)
	* [x] 3D projection on screen
* [x] Different textures for each side (N, E, S, W)
* [x] Floor and ceiling colors

	* [x] check valid characters
	* [x] check for map border gaps
	* [x] check type order (first textures and colors (which can be in any order), than the map data)
	* [x] check for rbg-range validity
	* [x] print explicit errors for each misconfiguration.

## Bonus:
